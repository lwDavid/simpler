# Multi-Communication-Domain Implementation

This document tracks the implementation status for multiple communication
domains.  It complements the design note in
[`multi-comm-domain.md`](multi-comm-domain.md) and is intentionally written as
a completion ledger: what exists, what is deliberately absent, and what has
been validated.

## Current Surface

The only parent-level communication API is `CommDomainPlan`:

```python
comm_plan = CommDomainPlan(
    domains=[
        CommDomain(
            name="tp",
            worker_indices=[0, 1],
            window_size=tp_window_size,
            buffers=[
                CommBufferSpec("scratch", "float32", count, nbytes),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)

worker = Worker(level=3, device_ids=device_ids, comm_plan=comm_plan)
```

The low-level explicit path is still available when a caller must add
per-chip bootstrap data, such as host staging:

```python
plan = CommDomainPlan([...])
cfgs = [
    ChipBootstrapConfig(
        comm=plan.bootstrap_for_worker(i),
        host_inputs=[
            HostBufferStaging(
                domain_name="default",
                name="notify_counter",
                shm_name=rank_local_shm.name,
                size=4,
            ),
        ],
    )
    for i in range(nranks)
]

worker = Worker(level=3, device_ids=device_ids, chip_bootstrap_configs=cfgs)
```

`ChipBootstrapConfig.comm` accepts `list[ChipDomainBootstrapConfig]` or
`None`.  The old public `ChipCommBootstrapConfig` surface is removed.

## Feature Status

Implemented:

- `CommDomain`: name, ordered `worker_indices`, window size, and symmetric
  buffers.
- `CommDomainPlan`: parent-level source of truth for all domains in an L3
  worker.
- `bootstrap_for_worker(i)`: derives only the domains containing worker index
  `i`.
- Domain rank mapping: order in `worker_indices` defines `domain_rank`.
- Missing domain behavior: `ctx.domains[name]` is a normal dict lookup and
  raises `KeyError`.
- Symmetric buffer layout: every participant in one domain receives the same
  named buffer layout.
- Multiple domains per chip: a chip can publish more than one
  `ChipDomainContext`.
- Overlapping domains: the same chip may have independent ranks in different
  domains.
- `ChipBootstrapConfig.comm`: takes the derived list from
  `CommDomainPlan.bootstrap_for_worker`.
- Explicit host staging: stays on `ChipBootstrapConfig`, keyed by
  `(domain_name, buffer_name)`.
- `Worker(..., comm_plan=...)`: creates per-chip bootstrap configs inside the
  L3 parent.
- Explicit `chip_bootstrap_configs`: still supported for host staging and
  manual bootstrap control.
- Hidden base communicator/window: one base communicator and one base window
  per L3 worker.
- Domain-local `CommContext`: each visible domain gets its own
  kernel-visible `CommContext*`.
- HCCL base-window slicing: domain windows are slices of the hidden base
  window.
- Sim backend slicing: sim mirrors the domain slicing contract for tests and
  examples.
- Bootstrap mailbox domains: publishes named domain results and rejects
  duplicate names.
- Domain-aware Python context: communication access is through
  `ChipContext.domains[name]`.
- Public old single-domain config removal: no public
  `ChipCommBootstrapConfig` compatibility path remains.

Not implemented by design:

- HCCL collective kernels.  PTO-ISA RMA kernels use HCOMM/HCCL windows only.
- Visible meta domain.  No all-device logical domain is exposed without
  buffers.
- Independent root-info per domain.  The implementation derives domain views
  from one base setup.
- Automatic window sizing.  Domain `window_size` remains explicit, matching
  current style.

## Bootstrap Flow

```text
L3 parent
  owns CommDomainPlan
  validates all domain names, worker indices, windows, and buffers
  for each chip worker i:
    derives comm = plan.bootstrap_for_worker(i)
    creates ChipBootstrapConfig(comm=comm, host staging=optional)
    attaches private base communicator metadata
        |
        v
chip child
  initializes one hidden base communicator
  allocates one hidden base communication window
  derives one domain-local CommContext for each received domain config
  carves named buffers inside that domain's window slice
  stages requested host inputs
  publishes named domain contexts through ChipBootstrapChannel
        |
        v
L3 orchestration
  domain = ctx.domains["tp"]
  passes domain.buffer_ptrs["scratch"] and domain.device_ctx to kernels
```

Workers outside a domain receive no config for that domain and publish no
`ctx.domains[name]` entry.

## Host Staging

Host staging is not part of a communication domain.  A domain describes a
symmetric communication contract: membership, dense rank order, window size,
and buffer layout.  Host staging describes per-chip movement between
parent-owned POSIX shared memory and one chip's already declared domain
buffer.

The split is:

- `CommDomain`: symmetric domain contract shared by participants;
- `CommDomainPlan`: parent-level source of truth for all domains;
- `ChipBootstrapConfig`: per-chip transport object sent to one chip child;
- `HostBufferStaging`: per-chip shared-memory source or destination.

Therefore host staging stays on `ChipBootstrapConfig`.  Each staging entry
that targets a communication buffer includes `domain_name`; the effective key
is `(domain_name, buffer_name)`, so two domains can both own `"scratch"`.

## Simulation Backend Extension

The sim backend is not only a compatibility target.  It is the cheapest place
to validate parent-side derivation, child bootstrap, missing-domain behavior,
domain rank order, duplicate-name rejection, window slicing, and host-staging
scoping without needing hardware.

The extension uses the same visible contract as onboard execution:
`ctx.domains[name]` contains a domain-local context and buffer pointers.  The
difference is only the transport used under that contract.  On hardware, the
base window comes from HCCL/HCOMM resources.  On sim, the base window is a
POSIX shared-memory segment mapped by each simulated rank process.

The sim flow is:

```text
comm_init(base_rank, base_size, rootinfo_path)
  creates a base handle whose shared-memory identity is derived from
  rootinfo_path and the parent process id

comm_alloc_windows(base, total_base_window_size)
  creates or opens one shared-memory segment:
    [header][rank-0 base window][rank-1 base window]...
  fills the base CommContext:
    rankId = base_rank
    rankNum = base_size
    winSize = total_base_window_size
    windowsIn[i] = local process pointer to rank i base window
    windowsOut[i] = windowsIn[i]

for each visible domain on this chip:
  comm_derive_context(
      base,
      rank_ids=domain worker indices in domain-rank order,
      domain_rank=this chip's dense domain rank,
      window_offset=domain slice offset in the base window,
      window_size=domain window size,
  )
```

`comm_derive_context` allocates a new host-resident `CommContext` for the
domain.  It remaps dense domain ranks onto the selected base ranks and applies
the domain's slice offset:

```text
derived.rankId = domain_rank
derived.rankNum = len(rank_ids)
derived.winSize = window_size
derived.windowsIn[d] = base.windowsIn[rank_ids[d]] + window_offset
derived.windowsOut[d] = base.windowsOut[rank_ids[d]] + window_offset
```

This is enough for CPU-sim kernels to use the same scalar `device_ctx` shape
as hardware kernels: the scalar still points to a `CommContext`, and the
domain-local rank ids still index `windowsIn[]` and `windowsOut[]`.

There is one important address-model difference from hardware.  Hardware
communication windows are device-visible addresses produced by HCCL/HCOMM.
Sim windows are process-local pointers into the same shared-memory file.  The
numeric pointer values may differ between rank processes because each process
maps the file independently.  This is acceptable because each simulated kernel
dereferences only the `CommContext` built inside its own process; shared memory
provides visibility of the underlying bytes.

The sim backend also keeps the old single-domain behavior as a special case of
the same mechanism: one `CommDomain("default", ...)` derives one visible
context from the base window.  No old public bootstrap surface is required.

What sim intentionally does not do:

- it does not model HCCL transport performance;
- it does not run HCCL collective kernels;
- it does not require cross-process numeric address equality;
- it does not create independent root-info communicators per domain.

The focused sim tests cover:

- `CommDomainPlan.bootstrap_for_worker` rank derivation and validation;
- L3 `Worker(..., comm_plan=...)` creation of per-chip bootstrap configs;
- overlapping domains where one worker has both `tp` and `pp` contexts;
- different `device_ctx` and buffer pointers for different domains;
- absent-domain behavior through missing `ctx.domains[name]`;
- host-staging scoping by `(domain_name, buffer_name)`;
- bootstrap error propagation and cleanup.

## Example Coverage

Two new L3 examples now cover the multi-domain surface:

- `domain_rank_map`: a small communication example.  It shows the difference
  from single-domain usage by checking domain-local ranks, absent domains,
  separate slices for overlapping memberships, and one real allreduce per
  domain.  Revalidated on 2026-05-13 with CANN 8.5 on devices `12,13,14`.
- `dual_domain_overlap`: a real data example.  It runs two overlapping
  domains, performs domain-local allreduce in both, then runs affine compute
  and checks real outputs against host goldens.

Existing one-domain communication examples were also migrated to the new
surface.  They are still important because they prove the single-domain case
is expressed through the same API rather than through a compatibility path.

## Validation Status

Validation date: 2026-05-18.

### Build And Unit Tests

- Editable build after the PR 752 rebase: pass.

  ```bash
  pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
  ```

- Real-device `tests/st` after the PR 752 rebase: pass on `a2a3` devices
  `2-5`.  Runtime artifacts were rebuilt once serially, then pytest was run
  without `--build` so parallel workers only loaded stable `build/lib`
  outputs.

  ```bash
  python - <<'PY'
  from simpler_setup.runtime_builder import RuntimeBuilder
  builder = RuntimeBuilder(platform="a2a3")
  for runtime in ("host_build_graph", "tensormap_and_ringbuffer"):
      builder.get_binaries(runtime, build=True)
  PY

  pytest tests/st --platform a2a3 --device 2-5 -v \
      --pto-session-timeout 600 \
      --pto-isa-commit 50d9c806c3e351d5039c9f0f02a267590420b4d9 \
      --clone-protocol ssh --require-pto-isa
  ```

- Focused unit and sim tests: pass, 30 tests.

  ```bash

      tests/ut/py/test_worker/test_worker_distributed_sim.py \

  ```

- Hardware bootstrap unit test: pass.

  ```bash
  pytest tests/ut/py/test_worker/test_bootstrap_context_hw.py \
      -q -s --platform a2a3 --device 3-4
  ```

- Docs lint: pass.

### Example Results

  - This includes the migrated L3 communication examples, the two new
    multi-domain examples, the L2 examples, and the SDMA async completion
    demo.

  - One-domain EP dispatch/combine.

- `a2a3/async_notify_demo`
  - Sim: pass with `-p a2a3sim`.
  - Hardware: pass in the examples sweep.
  - Explicit bootstrap plus host staging.

  - Hardware: pass in the examples sweep.

- `a2a3/sdma_async_completion_demo`
  - Sim: not applicable.
  - Hardware: covered by the real-device CI sweep.  The post-rebase fix
    removes an invalid parent-side prelaunch `CommContext` read.
  - The demo now uses the kernel output comparison as the SDMA workspace
    signal.  The previous Python precheck copied a device `CommContext` into
    a parent-process ctypes buffer through a forked chip child; that copy only
    updated the child's private address space and therefore falsely reported
    zero workspace fields.

- `a5/async_notify_demo`
  - Sim: pass with `-p a5sim`.
  - Hardware: not run.
  - A5 sim explicit bootstrap path.

- `a5/deferred_notify_demo`
  - Sim: pass with `-p a5sim`.
  - Hardware: not run.
  - A5 sim deferred notify path.

The SDMA demo is not tracked as a remaining multi-domain limitation.  Its
post-rebase failure came from the demo's Python-side inspection path, not from
communication-domain bootstrap or the derived device `CommContext` consumed by
the kernel.

## Grep Gates

The migrated public examples should stay clean for these stale surfaces:

```bash
rg -n "ChipCommBootstrapConfig" examples
rg -n "comm=ChipCommBootstrapConfig|rootinfo_path" examples
rg -n "ctx\\.buffer_ptrs|ctx\\.device_ctx|ctx\\.rank|ctx\\.nranks" examples
```

Repository-wide checks should also keep generated or local-only paths out of
the design documents.

## Non-Goals

- no visible meta communication domain;
- no independent root-info communicator per domain;
- no HCCL collective kernels;
- no implicit current domain inside kernels;
- no lazy first-use domain creation;
- no automatic `window_size` derivation in this implementation.
