"""Hardware smoke test for `Worker(comm_plan=...)` on 2 Ascend devices.

End-to-end equivalent of ``test_bootstrap_context_hw.py`` but driven through
the top-level ``Worker`` class so the bootstrap happens inside forked chip
children and the parent observes it via ``worker.chip_contexts``.

Deliberately no ``comm_barrier`` — that path still trips HCCL 507018 on
some CANN builds (tracked separately).  The non-barrier invariants are
enough to prove each chip's communicator is up and both ranks carved a
GVA-visible window.
